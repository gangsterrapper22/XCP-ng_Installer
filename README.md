# XCP-ng_Installer

This Repo can be used to Build the XCP-ng Installer for the XCP-ng Center which you will find here: https://github.com/xcp-ng/xenadmin
The Source has to be compiled first of the XCP-ng Center, that this Installer can be build. Currently there are static paths in the Source, which you have to Edit to your location in the Product.wxs File, but this will be changed in the Future. Currently it does only build an msi Installer without GUI and no Shorcuts will be created.
